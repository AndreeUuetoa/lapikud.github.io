                              computer science students who liked to get together and dilly-dally. Reason why we were created a MTÜ ( nonprofit organization )
                              was to get a .ee domain. The name \"Lapikud\" comes from times when computer science specialty's identification code was \"LAP\".
                              Back in 2002 til 2010 the organization's goal was simply to fill IT students' time and support their studies.
                              Since 2011 Lapikud titled themselves a Software development club and focused on involving students in development projects.
                              In Spring 2012 a first ever thesis hatched from Lapikud was defended and graded 5."
